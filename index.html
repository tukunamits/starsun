Output

The reverse of the given number is: 456789
Reverse a number using for loop
In the following program, we have replaced the while loop by a for loop. It also removes the last digit of the number, after each iteration. When the condition, number!=0 becomes false, the loop exits and we get the reversed number.

for( ;number != 0; number=number/10)

int remainder = number % 10;  
reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder;  
}
